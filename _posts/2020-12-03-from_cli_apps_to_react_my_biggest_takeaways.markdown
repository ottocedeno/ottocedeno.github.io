I just finished my final project review today for my React/Redux project.  Bittersweet ending.  On the one hand I'm so happy that I've finished an entire year of online education/stuck with it all the way.  On the other hand, I'm a bit sad to say goodbye to this curriculum.

The Flatiron program offered some incredible structure and great habits.  How to take a daunting task, "Learn to Code" and break it into so many (and I mean many) micro-goals.  It's been a great experience and as I leave I suppose my last blog post should be to help/encourage those just starting.  After all, during my first days, weeks, and month, I was looking all over the place for some wisdom and guidance.

So here are a few of my big takeaways that hopefully will help you while you go on your journey with the Flatiron Bootcamp.

## Pace yourself.  Don't burn out.
My learning coach gave me an amazing excel sheet that broke down the pace I needed to go in order to hit my goal (finish in less than a year).  One of my biggest mistakes was trying to get ahead.  Like, WAY ahead.  Trust me, it serves no master. Trust the pace, and make sure you're on a plan that's realistic with your schedule and also allow for some leeway incase you need to slow down a bit.  If you want to speed up, fine, but don't go too far.  Give your brain a break.  Trust me, you'll need it later (I'm looking at you Redux lessons).

## Supliment early and often
This one is an easy one, but often overlooked.  Again, without burning yourself out, try to add in some other lessons/supplimental reading.  It's really helpful to get a second perspective when you're brand new to CS.  When I was working in the Rails section, I bought The Rails 5 Way, and it was my rock.  Which brings me to my next semi-controversial point...

## Buy coding books
Here's the skinny.  There's only so many hours you can stare at a screen and it be ok for you.  But, sometimes, you're the type of person that wants to keep going / can't shut off until you figure something out. Fine. My suggestion, add supplimental learning with books on Ruby, Rails, JS etc.  I personally loved reading "Clean Code" on the side.  It was nice to be outdoors not staring at a screen but still adding to my knowledge base.

## Portfolio Projects... KISS
Keep it simple stupid.  Trust me here.  Think of something fun, but keep it to MVP or less.  I made one massive mistake for my Rails Project to build something that was just way too big and it took a month when it really should have been a few weeks.  You'll have plenty of time to build your magnum opus.  Your portfolio projects are not the time nor the place.  Use them to practice and push yourself just a bit outside your comfort zone.

## Learn to learn, not to code
And finally, my biggest "AH HA!" with the program.  I think everyone goes in thinking, "I want to learn to code" and that translates into, "I must be able to look at a code editor and know exactly what to do, especially with the basics." BUZZER. Wrong!  What you should be focusing on from day one is learning how to learn and research.  The trick with coding at a higher level is not in memorizing a million things, methods, patterns, etc.  But getting a strong foundation in the "gist" and knowing what to google.  In fact, learning to code is equivalent to learning to google.

Hope these help.  Don't give up, even when it gets hard (it will).
